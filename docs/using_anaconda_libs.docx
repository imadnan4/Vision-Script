Using Anaconda Libraries Outside Anaconda Prompt

Quick Guide to Run Python Backend with Anaconda Libraries

1. Key Steps We Used:
   • We didn't need to reinstall any libraries
   • We used the Python from Anaconda directly
   • We fixed the OpenMP error with environment variables

2. The Working Command:
   ```
   $env:KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK="TRUE"
   $env:KMP_WARNINGS="0"
   & "$env:USERPROFILE\Anaconda3\python.exe" main_test.py
   ```

3. Why This Works:
   • Uses Anaconda's Python directly (from Anaconda3 folder)
   • Accesses all libraries already installed in Anaconda
   • Fixes the OpenMP error that was blocking execution
   • No need to activate conda environment

4. If You Get Errors:
   • Make sure you're using PowerShell
   • Check if Anaconda is installed in the default location (Users\YourUsername\Anaconda3)
   • If Anaconda is installed elsewhere, replace the path accordingly

5. Alternative Method:
   If the above doesn't work, you can also:
   a. Find your Anaconda Python path:
      • Usually in C:\Users\YourUsername\Anaconda3\python.exe
      • Or wherever you installed Anaconda
   b. Use that full path to run your script:
      ```
      "C:\Users\YourUsername\Anaconda3\python.exe" main_test.py
      ```

Remember: The key is using Anaconda's Python directly with the environment variables set, rather than trying to activate the conda environment.
