# Modern OCR Solution Documentation

## 1. Problem Statement
In today's digital age, organizations face significant challenges in managing physical documents. This project addresses the critical need to digitize physical documents through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. The solution enables:

- Conversion of physical documents into editable digital formats
- Extraction of text for analysis and processing
- Export capabilities in multiple standard formats
- Real-time document processing through camera input
- User-friendly interface for non-technical users

## 2. Technical Architecture Overview
The solution is built using a modern, modular architecture:

### Frontend:
- Framework: React with TypeScript
- Build Tool: Vite
- UI Library: Tailwind CSS with Framer Motion animations
- State Management: React Context API

### Backend:
- Framework: Python Flask
- OCR Engine: Tesseract OCR
- Image Processing: OpenCV
- File Export: python-docx and openpyxl libraries

### Infrastructure:
- Development: Local environment with hot-reloading
- Production: Docker containerization
- API Communication: RESTful endpoints with JSON payloads

## 3. Frontend Implementation
The frontend is organized into modular components with clear responsibilities:

### ImageUpload Component
- Drag-and-drop file upload using react-dropzone
- Image preview with URL.createObjectURL
- File validation:
  - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, BMP
  - Maximum size: 10MB
  - Resolution validation
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Progress indicators for upload and processing

### RealTimeDetection Component
